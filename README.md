## Dependencies between contributions

The "contributions" folder contains Coq files that eventually leads to different formal proofs of the theorem type `sort_prog`:
```coq
Theorem sort_prog : forall (l : list nat), {l' : list nat | sorted l' /\ permutation l' l}.
```

> **NOTE:** The original and full documentation of formalization of different variations of divide-and-conquer algorithm design paradigm for lists and the different sorting algorithms' proofs and programs can be found on https://github.com/jinxing1990/coq-formalized-divide-and-conquer.

The following are the dependencies between the Coq files that lead to different proofs of the theorem type `coq sort_prog`:

LEGENDS:

Edge: Type  
Node (dotted): Incomplete (sub)proof term   
Node (solid): Complete (sub)proof term  
Node (green): Contribution from AI System (CoqHammer)

## Prerequitses

1. Coq Version 8.12
2. OCaml [most versions will work] (if you would like to test the extracted files)
3. CoqHammer

    Just need to install coq-hammer-tactics:
    ```
    $ opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
    $ opam install coq-hammer-tactics
    ```

## Make and compile all files

1. Go to the "coq-chain" folder.
2. Run the Makefile in terminal with the following command:
    ```
    $ make
    ```
3. To test the extracted files, run the following command in terminal:
    ```
    $ make test_extraction
    ```
> NOTE: To clean all compiled files, run the following command in terminal: ` $ make clean`.
